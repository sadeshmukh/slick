Slick runs Slack's own `app.asar` with a custom Electron (with the handy BYOE acronym, bring your own electron) preload that injects themes and plugins. This method allows us to modify Slack's interface and behavior without altering its files, so auto-updates still work and there's no open debug port or resident watcher.

This client targets MacOS, with Windows and Linux beta support (see below).

## Installation

You will need the official [Slack app](https://slack.com/downloads/mac) (not the App Store version) installed at `/Applications/Slack.app`, since Slick runs Slack's own code.

The fastest way in is to use the installer script. Re-run it any time to update. Slick also checks for new GitHub Releases about every 6 hours and points you at the latest build when one is available.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kh0/slick/main/install.sh | bash
```

Prefer doing it by hand? Grab the latest prebuilt app from the [releases page](https://github.com/3kh0/slick/releases/latest) and pick the build for your Mac (check > About This Mac > Chip if unsure):

- `Slick-build-N-arm64` — **Apple Silicon** (if there is a M in the name)
- `Slick-build-N-x64` — **Intel** Macs

Each comes as a `.dmg` (open it and drag Slick to Applications) or a `.zip`.

### But it says "Slick can't be opened!"

If you run into this error, it means the app is not notarized, which is expected. Bypassing this is trivial:

Double click the app to open it. You should see a warning that it can't be opened. Now, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll down to the Slick message, click **Open Anyway**, and launch it again. After that it opens normally.

You can also use this terminal command to bypass the warning without opening the app first:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Slick.app
```

## Build from source

If you'd rather build it yourself (or hack on it), clone the repo and run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This downloads an Electron matching your installed Slack and builds `~/Applications/Slick.app` locally; re-run it any time to stay fresh. You'll need a modern version of Node.js.

If you want to debug or poke around at things, you can find more manual scripts in the scripts/ folder, but the install script should be all you need for normal use.

## Windows (beta)

> [!NOTE]
> Windows support is new and somehow even more unstable and prone to jank than the Mac build. Both the standalone Slack download and the Microsoft Store version are supported. On ARM PCs the x64 Slack runs via emulation magic and Slick works, but expect a big performance hit.

Install Slack first, then run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kh0/slick/main/install.ps1" | iex
```

To uninstall or pass other arguments to the script, try this:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kh0/slick/main/install.ps1))) -Uninstall -Purge
```

### Building Windows

Clone the repo and run the following

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

You also have some nice flags to play around with locally: `-Uninstall`, `-Purge`, `-RestoreHandler`, and `-Force` to overwrite any existing install.

## Linux (beta)

> [!NOTE]
> Linux support is basic and currently expects an x86_64 Linux machine for real Slack runtime testing. Apple Silicon arm64 VMs can build the wrapper, but official Slack for Linux is x86_64 only.

Install the official Slack `.deb` first, then clone the repo and run:

```bash
./install-linux.sh
```

This builds `byoe/slick-linux`, installs a desktop entry, registers `slack://`, and launches Slick. For manual launch or debugging:

```bash
./scripts/launch-linux.sh
./scripts/launch-linux.sh --debug 9223
```

Known limitations: Electron must match Slack's Electron major version, Wayland/X11 handling is minimal, and `--no-sandbox` is used for the BYOE launcher.

## Release versioning

Slick releases use integer build tags: `v13`, `v14`, `v15`, and so on. The GitHub Release title should read like `Slick Build 67`.

Internally, release builds use a normal macOS short version (`1.0.<build>`, e.g. `1.0.67` for build 67), while the bundle build number (`CFBundleVersion`) is just the integer `67`.

To ship the next build, tag and push the next integer:

```bash
BUILD=67 # replace with the next build number
git tag "v$BUILD"
git push origin "v$BUILD"
```

## Themes

Themes are defined in the `themes/` folder as JSON files exporting the following:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Super cool epic theme",
  "palette": { "highlight1": { "100": "139,92,246" } }, // --dt_color-plt-<ramp>-<shade>, raw "r,g,b"
  "sidebar": { "nav-bg": "#1A1525" }, // --p-team_sidebar__<key>
  "vars": { "--any-css-var": "value" }, // overrides
  "css": "selector { prop: val !important; }", // raw css (string or array)
}
```

No theme is applied by default, but you can pick one from the Slick tab in Preferences. `themes/amoled.json` (true black) and `themes/ultraviolet.json` (violet) are working examples. More documentation pending.

## Plugins

Please refer to [`plugins/README.md`](plugins/README.md) for the plugins documentation. I promise it is not boring.
